## What is GeoHeatWhisper?

GeoHeatWhisper breaks down geographic areas (cities, neighborhoods, zip codes) into grids and checks Google Maps rankings from each grid cell. This creates interactive heatmaps showing:
- Red zones (Rank 1–3) where you rank highly
- Orange zones (Rank 4–10) with good visibility
- Yellow zones (Rank 11–20) with moderate visibility
- Grey zones (Unranked) where you don't appear

Traditional rank checkers only show position from one point. GeoHeatWhisper reveals spatial reality: you might rank #1 downtown but #15 in suburbs.
